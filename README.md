# Rezervare-Mese-Biliard

### This project describes a business which has 6 pool tables. The app offers the user the possibility to reserve a pool table anytime within the time interval 15:00 - 21:00 for a time period chosen by the user (including minutes). The user can view the availability of a table on a specific day. Additionally, the user can access statistics about each individual table (such as how much it has been used in the last month in terms of hours and minutes, the total number of reservations from the last month, etc.).

### In this project I used I/O file handling and advanced data structures such as HashTable and Binary Search Tree for storing and manipulating data.
